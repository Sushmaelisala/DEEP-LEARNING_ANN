🧠 Key Concepts
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
A computational model inspired by the structure of the human brain, used for tasks like classification and regression.

2. Forward Propagation
Flow of data through the layers to compute output.

3. Loss Function
Calculates how far the prediction is from the true value.

4. Backpropagation
Updates weights using the gradient of the loss to minimize error.

5. Learning Rate
Controls how much weights are adjusted during training.
